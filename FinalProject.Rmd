This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library("ggplot2", lib.loc="/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.1/Resources/library")
library("plyr", lib.loc="/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.1/Resources/library")
library("reshape2", lib.loc="/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.1/Resources/library")
library("ggthemes", lib.loc="/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.1/Resources/library")

#Load data into a variable:
data.in <- read.delim(file = "output/combined_gapMinder.tsv", header = TRUE, sep='\t')

#subset the three countries that I want
data.sub <- subset(data.in, country == 'Afghanistan'|country=='Brazil'|country=='China')

#Here is an alternative to the method above.
data.sub <- subset(data.in, country %in% c('Afghanistan','Brazil','China')) 

#plot x axis year and y axis gdp per capita with each country in a seperate plot
myplot <- ggplot(data = data.sub, aes(x = year, y = gdpPercap, color = country)) + 
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  facet_grid(. ~ country)
summary(myplot)

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(myplot)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
